The hero is the blue capsule.
He can be moved with ZQSD and use his skills with T and Y.
The skills aren't implemented, they only slow or immobilize him.

The mobs are the green capsules and do nothing but running in circle.

The interesting parts :
 - The 'Skills' scene object contains all skill descriptions.
 - The 'Actors' scene object contains ... the actor descriptions.
 - The SceneScript show how to create actors.
